## Hi, I’m Solène

I am a Bachelor’s student in Economics at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) with a strong interest in data science and machine learning. Through my studies and projects, I explore how data-driven methods can support better business and investment decisions.

Alongside my economics degree, I am completing the Data Science Fundamentals (DSF) certificate, where I work with applied data analysis, machine learning models, and real-world datasets. I particularly enjoy turning data into clear insights through modeling, careful analysis, and visualization.

This website showcases selected academic and personal projects that reflect my learning journey at the intersection of economics, data, and decision-making.
