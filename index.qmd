As an Economics student at the University of St. Gallen (HSG), I am interested in how data can support smarter business decisions. I enjoy learning new data science tools and exploring their connections to business and entrepreneurship, and I am eager to continue learning in this direction through my studies, projects, and internships.

This website showcases selected academic and personal projects that reflect my learning journey.
