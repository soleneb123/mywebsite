# 1. Introduction and Motivation

Taking a bus, tram, or train is part of daily life, but the experience is always more enjoyable when one can find a seat and avoid overcrowding. Anticipating passenger demand is therefore a key challenge for both travelers and public transport operators.

This project develops a machine learning model to forecast the number of boarding passengers on Geneva’s public transport network (TPG) on an hourly basis. Such forecasts could help passengers choose less crowded travel times and support TPG in short-term capacity planning.

We focus on a network-wide prediction setting, capturing broad mobility patterns while respecting real-world forecasting constraints such as strong seasonality, non-linear demand, and structural breaks, such as COVID-19 period.

This work was completed as a group project in the Data Science Fundamentals (DSF) program at the University of St. Gallen.

# 2. Methodology

## Datasets cleaning

### Core Passenger Data

We used the TPG ridership dataset, covering 2019 onwards with hourly counts for the whole network (\~58,000 observations).

Data cleaning steps:

-   Removed rows with missing or non-definitive values
-   Excluded 2 and 3 am slots due to insufficient data
-   One-hot encoded categorical variables such as day-of-week and schedule type

Final dataset: 54,098 rows × 61 columns.

## TPG Dataset Cleaning
``` python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("00_datasets/original/tpg.csv", sep=";")

df = df.dropna(subset=["Time Slot"])        # Remove rows with missing Time Slot

df = df[df["donnees_definitives"] == True]  # Remove non-definitive data

df = df[df["Time Slot"] != "-"]             # Remove invalid time slots

df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])     # Parse date and time
df["Time Slot"] = pd.to_numeric(df["Time Slot"])

df = df[~df["Time Slot"].isin([2, 3])]      # Drop 2 and 3 am observations

# One-hot encoding of categorical variables
week_day_one_hot = pd.get_dummies(df["Day Week"], prefix="day")
schedule_type_one_hot = pd.get_dummies(df["Schedule Type"], prefix="schedule")
months_one_hot = pd.get_dummies(df["month"], prefix="month")
years_one_hot = pd.get_dummies(df["year"], prefix="year")
time_slots_one_hot = pd.get_dummies(df["Time Slot"], prefix="slot")

# Combine all features
df_encoded = pd.concat([df, week_day_one_hot, schedule_type_one_hot, 
    months_one_hot, years_one_hot, time_slots_one_hot], axis=1)

# Drop redundant and original categorical columns
columns_to_drop = [
    "Day Week",              # Encoded as day_
    "Schedule Type",         # Encoded as schedule_  
    "Index Day Week",        # Redundant with day_of_week
    "donnees_definitives",   # All True after "False" values were removed
    "Week Index"             # Not used in our predictive models
]

df_encoded = df_encoded.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)
df_encoded = df_encoded.dropna().reset_index(drop=True) # drop any remaining NaN values

df_final = df_encoded.sort_values(["Date", "Time Slot"]).reset_index(drop=True)
```

### Weather Data

Weather influences passenger behavior. We included daily average temperature, rainfall, and wind speed from a station 5 km from Geneva city center. To avoid leakage (i.e. to ensure that only information available at prediction time is used), weather features were lagged by one day.

### Demographics and Abonnements

-   Canton population data (yearly) to capture structural shifts,
-   Counts of GA, Half-Fare, and Unireso subscriptions filtered to Geneva postal codes, aggregated yearly,
-   2025 values extrapolated from 2024 growth rates

### Events in Geneva

-   Servette FC football matches,
-   Concerts at Arena de Genève.

These events were encoded as binary features.

All datasets were merged by date to create the final modeling dataframe.

## Preprocessing

We experimented several preprocessing methods (applied to our numerical features) to optimize model stability and performance, implemented with a scikit-learn pipeline.

-   Standardization gave the lowest MAE/MSE for most models
-   Min-Max scaling performed similarly for linear models
-   Non-linear transformations (Yeo-Johnson, Quantile) generally worsened performance
-   Random Forests is robust to feature scaling and does not require preprocessing


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Min-Max Preprocessing Code
``` python
# Creating the pipeline for preprocessing and model fitting
num_feature = ['average_temp', "rain (mm)","snow (mm)","avg_wind_speed (km/h)",
               "Number of Stops_lag_1w",
               "population", "#unireso","#GA","#half-fare",
               "lag_24h", "lag_1w", "lag_3h"]

preprocess = ColumnTransformer(
    [("minmax", MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1)), num_feature)],
    remainder = "passthrough")

y_train_s = y_train

pip = Pipeline([
    ("prep", preprocess),
    ("model", LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True))
    ]).fit(X_train, y_train_s)

# De-standardize y

```

## Feature Engineering

To improve predictive performance, we engineered additional lagged features designed to capture temporal dependencies, trends, and recurring patterns.

-   For passenger counts: 24-hour lag, 1-week lag, 3-hour lag
-   For number of stops per time slot: 1-week lag (avoid data leakage, nb stops is not known before the hour was realized)
-   Calendar variables: Year, month, day of month, Day-of-week, schedule type, time slot (all one-hot encoded)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Lagged Features Code
``` python
# Lagged Number of Stops
# sort by date and then time slot   
df = df.sort_values(['Date', 'Time Slot']).reset_index(drop=True)

# shift by 22 rows * 7 (1 day = 22 observations, since we dropped 2 and 3am)
# shift works because we have equally many observations per time slot across the dataset (2,459)
df['Number of Stops_lag_1w'] = df['Number of Stops'].shift(22 * 7)

# Lagged Boarding passengers
df["lag_24h"] = df["Number of Boarding Passengers"].shift(22)     # same time yesterday
df["lag_1w"] = df["Number of Boarding Passengers"].shift(22 * 7)  # same time 1 week before
df["lag_3h"] = np.where(df["Time Slot"]==4,                       # 3 hours before
                        df["Number of Boarding Passengers"].shift(1),
                        df["Number of Boarding Passengers"].shift(3))
```
:::

## Visualizations
From the below correlation matrix, three observations can be made:

1. **Dominant Seasonality**: the 1-week lag (0.95) and 24-hour lag (0.82) are the strongest predictors, proving high temporal periodicity.


2. **Demographic Redudancy**: Population, Year, and Subscriptions are highly  colinear, which requires regularization.


3. **Weak External Signals**: Weather and Event features show near-zero correlation (<0.05), suggesting a limited global impact.

![Correlation Heatmap of Features](images/correlation.png){width="3169"}

# 3. Modeling Strategy

We evaluated 21 configurations across:

-   **Model families**: Linear, Neural Network, Random Forest
-   **Time-series Cross-validation** (TimeSeriesSplit)
-   **Preprocessing techniques**: Standardization, Min-Max, Yeo-Johnson
-   **COVID-19** inclusion/exclusion

All models were trained and evaluated using a time-aware validation strategy to respect the temporal ordering of observations.

## 3.1 Naïve Predictions:

Naïve benchmarks provide a critical reference point for assessing whether complex models add real predictive value. We implemented three simple baselines: predicting the last observed value, the historical mean, and the historical median for each time slot.

Our goal: build models outperforming MAE of 18,000 (obtained with simple these naïve methods).

## 3.2 Linear Models

### Basic Linear Regression: Focus on Simplicity

We first estimated a standard linear regression model using calendar, weather, and demographic features. This model serves as a transparent and interpretable baseline, highlighting the limits of linear assumptions in the presence of strong non-linear demand patterns.

### Linear Model with Time Lags: Learning from the Past

Incorporating lagged passenger counts substantially improves performance by allowing the model to exploit temporal dependencies, both very short term fluctuations and weekly patterns in passenger demand.

### Cross Validation

Passenger demand forecasting is inherently a time-series problem: predictions must always be made using past information only. Standard random cross-validation techniques would therefore be inappropriate, as they mix past and future observations and lead to overly optimistic results. To address this, we applied time-aware cross-validation using **TimeSeriesSplit**. Concretely, the data is split into successive training and validation folds using an expanding window approach. Each fold trains the model on historical data and evaluates it on a strictly later time period.

![Expanding Window Time Series Cross Validation.](images/crossvalidation.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}
All preprocessing steps (scaling, transformations, feature selection) were embedded inside a scikit-learn Pipeline, ensuring that transformations are learned exclusively from the training portion of each fold. This design fully prevents data leakage and guarantees a fair evaluation.

Hyperparameters (such as regularization strength or tree depth) were tuned over wide ranges, with the optimal configuration automatically selected based on average validation performance. Compared to rolling-window validation, the expanding-window approach is better suited to capturing long-term seasonal patterns (weekly and yearly cycles) that are central to public transport demand.


### Regularized Linear Models (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net)

Regularization techniques were applied to mitigate overfitting and handle multicollinearity among features. Lasso performed best among linear models, particularly when COVID-19 observations were excluded from training.

## 3.3 Neural Network

We implemented a multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressor with a funnel-shaped architecture (128–64–32 neurons) for feature compression. 

- Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to capture non-linear spikes (e.g. rush hours). 

- Preprocessing: Strict normalization wrapped in a Pipeline to prevent data leakage. 

- Regularization: L2 penalty and Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.

## 3.4 Random Forest

The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most accurate model overall. Its ensemble structure allows it to capture complex non-linear interactions and overlapping seasonal patterns (daily, weekly, yearly) while remaining robust to noise. A cross validation was also applied to the Random Forest models (as well as on neural networks) with the package RandomizedSearchedCV.

Performance: 

- MAE ≈ 1,500 
- Relative error ≈ 6.4% 
- Equivalent to 6 trams worth of passengers per hour

**This represents a 50% improvement over the best linear model (Lasso without Covid).**

# 4. Results Interpretation

## Overview Model's Performances

Model performance was compared using test-set MAE.

![](images/results.png){width="3169"}

### Non-linear models clearly outperform linear approaches

Advanced models like Random Forest and Neural Networks achieve 45-50% better accuracy than linear models by capturing complex non-linear demand patterns.

### COVID-19 filtering is essential

Excluding the pandemic period yields a 35% improvement, confirming that training should focus on "normal" transport behavior.

# 5. Evaluation and Challenges

### Overfitting Trade-off: Bias VS Variance

While Random Forests achieved the highest accuracy, they also exhibited a higher degree of overfitting (2.2, VS 1.1 for linear models), highlighting the classic bias–variance trade-off in forecasting problems.

### Unsuccessful Approaches

-   Yeo-Johnson and Quantile transformations increased error
-   SARIMAX proved unfeasible due to complex, overlapping seasonalities

# 6. Outlook and Future Work

Several extensions could further enhance the practical value of this work: - Line-level or stop-level forecasting (data is publicly available) - Integration into real-time TPG apps (see image below) - Exploring Deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformers) - Probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty quantification

# 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates that network-wide passenger demand on Geneva’s TPG system can be forecast with high accuracy using machine learning methods. Random Forest models outperform linear approaches by effectively capturing non-linear, seasonal, and structural patterns.

Such forecasts could support both passenger decision-making and operational planning, illustrating how data science can contribute to more efficient and user-friendly public transport systems.
