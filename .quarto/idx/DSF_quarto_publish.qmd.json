Anticipating passenger demand is therefore a key challenge for both travelers and public transport operators.\n\nThis project develops a machine learning model to forecast the number of boarding passengers on Geneva’s public transport network (TPG) on an hourly basis. Such forecasts could help passengers choose less crowded travel times and support TPG in short-term capacity planning.\n\nWe focus on a network-wide prediction setting, capturing broad mobility patterns while respecting real-world forecasting constraints such as strong seasonality, non-linear demand, and structural breaks, such as COVID-19 period.\n\nThis work was completed as a group project in the Data Science Fundamentals (DSF) program at the University of St. Gallen.\n\n# 2. Methodology\n\n## Datasets cleaning\n\n### Core Passenger Data\n\nWe used the TPG ridership dataset, covering 2019 onwards with hourly counts for the whole network (\\~58,000 observations).\n\nData cleaning steps:\n\n-   Removed rows with missing or non-definitive values\n-   Excluded 2 and 3 am slots due to insufficient data\n-   One-hot encoded categorical variables such as day-of-week and schedule type\n\nFinal dataset: 54,098 rows × 61 columns.\n\n### Weather Data\n\nWeather influences passenger behavior. We included daily average temperature, rainfall, and wind speed from a station 5 km from Geneva city center. To avoid leakage (i.e. to ensure that only information available at prediction time is used), weather features were lagged by one day.\n\n### Demographics and Abonnements\n\n-   Canton population data (yearly) to capture structural shifts,\n-   Counts of GA, Half-Fare, and Unireso subscriptions filtered to Geneva postal codes, aggregated yearly,\n-   2025 values extrapolated from 2024 growth rates\n\n### Events in Geneva\n\n-   Servette FC football matches,\n-   Concerts at Arena de Genève These events were encoded as binary features.\n\nAll datasets were merged by date to create the final modeling dataframe.\n\n## Preprocessing\n\nWe experimented several preprocessing methods (applied to our numerical features) to optimize model stability and performance, implemented with a scikit-learn pipeline.\n\n-   Standardization gave the lowest MAE/MSE for most models\n-   Min-Max scaling performed similarly for linear models\n-   Non-linear transformations (Yeo-Johnson, Quantile) generally worsened performance\n-   Random Forests is robust to feature scaling and does not require preprocessing\n\n\n```python\n\n# Initial chronological train-test split (70-30%)\nsplit_idx = int(0.7 * len(df))\nX_train, X_test = X.iloc[:split_idx], X.iloc[split_idx:]\ny_train, y_test = y.iloc[:split_idx], y.iloc[split_idx:]\n\n# Creating the pipeline for preprocessing and model fitting\nnum_feature = ['average_temp', \"rain (mm)\",\"snow (mm)\",\"avg_wind_speed (km/h)\",\n               \"Number of Stops_lag_1w\",\n               \"population\", \"#unireso\",\"#GA\",\"#half-fare\",\n               \"lag_24h\", \"lag_1w\", \"lag_3h\"]\n\npreprocess = ColumnTransformer(\n    [(\"minmax\", MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1)), num_feature)],\n    remainder = \"passthrough\")\n\ny_train_s = y_train\n\npip = Pipeline([\n    (\"prep\", preprocess),\n    (\"model\", LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True))\n    ]).fit(X_train, y_train_s)\n\n# Prediction \ny_pred_train = pip.predict(X_train)\ny_pred_test = pip.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate errors\nmse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred_train)\nmse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_test)\nmae_train = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_pred_train)\nmae_test = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred_test)\n```\n\n``` python\nCode for Quantile Preprocessing -

Outlook and Future Work\n\nSeveral extensions could further enhance the practical value of this work: - Line-level or stop-level forecasting (data is publicly available) - Integration into real-time TPG apps (see image below) - Exploring Deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformers) - Probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty quantification\n\n![](images/goal.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"700\"}\n\n# 7. Conclusion\n\nThis project demonstrates that network-wide passenger demand on Geneva’s TPG system can be forecast with high accuracy using machine learning methods. Random Forest models outperform linear approaches by effectively capturing non-linear, seasonal, and structural patterns.\n\nSuch forecasts could support both passenger decision-making and operational planning, illustrating how data science can contribute to more efficient and user-friendly public transport systems.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Data Source\n\n-   [TPG Data](https://opendata.tpg.ch/explore/dataset/frequentation-journaliere-par-tranche-horaire/table/?disjunctive.jour_semaine&disjunctive.horaire_type&disjunctive.horaire_tranche_stop_theo&disjunctive.indice_semaine)\n-   [Weather Data](https://meteostat.net/en/place/ch/geneve?s=06700&t=2019-01-01/2025-10-24)\n-   [Population](https://www.pxweb.bfs.admin.ch/pxweb/fr/px-x-0102020000_101/px-x-0102020000_101/px-x-0102020000_101.px/)\n-   [GA Abonnement Count](data.sbb.ch/explore/dataset/generalabo-halbtax)\n-   [Half-fare and community network Abonnements](https://data.sbb.ch/explore/dataset/verbunde/information/)\n-   [Servette FC Football Matches](https://www.transfermarkt.fr/servette-fc/spielplan/verein/61/saison_id/2019/plus/1#C1)\n-   [Concerts at Arena Genève](https://www.geneva-arena.ch/fr/programme/?archive=2023)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project was completed as part of the Data Science Fundamentals (DSF) program at the University of St. Gallen.
